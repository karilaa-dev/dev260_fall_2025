## Performance Reflection

**When to use doubly linked lists:**
- When you need frequent insertions/deletions at both ends of the sequence
- When you need bidirectional traversal (forward and backward)
- When memory overhead is acceptable for the flexibility gained

**When to use other data structures:**
- **Arrays/ArrayLists**: When you need fast random access by index and infrequent insertions/deletions
- **Singly linked lists**: When you only need forward traversal and want lower memory usage
- **Hash tables**: When you need fast key-value lookups
- **Trees**: When you need ordered data with efficient search operations
