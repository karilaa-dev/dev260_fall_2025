# Assignment 5: Browser Navigation System - Implementation Notes

**Name:** Kyryl Andreiev

## Dual-Stack Pattern Understanding

**How the dual-stack pattern works for browser navigation:**
Back stack is log of all websites you visited, and forward stack only active when you decide to go back in this log/history. If you changed your mind, you can comeback to the latest page. And if you want to stay on old page, all websites in forward stack would be deleted. In both cases, forward stack exists temporary, until you open new website.
## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge faced:**
Most difficult part was actually just reviewing code, and determining what needs to be done. Code part was not difficult, especially after lab assignment.

**How you solved it:**
To solve this assignment most helpful was reviewing all code, before starting coding.

**Most confusing concept:**
How to connect back stack and forward stack, to meet assignment requirements.

## Code Quality

**What you're most proud of in your implementation:**
I wasn't proud of anything I done for this assignment. Not because my code is horrible, but because it was not that complicated.

**What you would improve if you had more time:**
GUI would be cool, because terminal interface requires to much attention to do something.

## Testing Approach

**How you tested your implementation:**
After I implemented one of the methods, I tested on positive scenarios and negative scenarios (good input, bad input).

**Issues you discovered during testing:**
Code was easy, so I didn't catch any bugs.

## Stretch Features

None implemented.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 1 hour, 35 minutes

**Breakdown:**

- Understanding the assignment: 30 minutes
- Implementing the 6 methods: 30 minutes
- Testing and debugging: 15 minutes
- Writing these notes: 20 minutes

**Most time-consuming part:** Understanding assignment and reading code was the longest and most difficult part. That requited most of the thinking.
