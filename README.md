## About This Repository

This repository contains my coursework for DEV 260, where I learned fundamental data structures and algorithms through hands-on C# implementation. The course covered everything from basic collections to advanced graph algorithms, with a focus on understanding performance characteristics, implementing core data structures from scratch, and applying them to real-world scenarios like file systems, spell checkers, and flight route optimization.

## Projects

### Labs

- **Lab Loops and Conditionals:** Introduction to C# control flow, loops, and conditional logic fundamentals

- **Lab Stacks:** Interactive action history system implementing LIFO behavior with undo/redo functionality using dual-stack patterns

- **Lab Queues:** IT Support Desk ticket management system demonstrating FIFO processing with priority handling

- **Lab Hashsets:** User management and permissions system exploring set operations (union, intersection, difference) for deduplication and role-based access control

- **Lab Trees:** Company employee management system using Binary Search Trees for O(log n) search operations and hierarchical data organization

### Assignments

- **Assignment DS Foundations:** Exploration of C#'s built-in data structures (Array, List, Stack, Queue, Dictionary, HashSet) through hands-on demos and performance benchmarking, analyzing Big-O complexity and time-space tradeoffs for membership checks

- **Assignment Array Sorting:** Multi-dimensional array fundamentals through board game implementation (Tic-Tac-Toe/Connect Four) and book catalog with recursive sorting algorithms (QuickSort/MergeSort), featuring 2D indexing for O(1) + O(log k) lookup performance

- **Assignment Stacks:** Browser navigation system simulating back/forward functionality using dual-stack pattern for URL history management

- **Assignment Queues:** Game matchmaking system with multiple queues (Casual, Ranked, QuickPlay) implementing skill-based player pairing and match outcome simulation

- **Assignment Hashsets:** Spell checker and vocabulary explorer using HashSet for O(1) dictionary lookups, text analysis, and misspelled word detection

- **Assignment Linked Lists:** Custom doubly linked list implementation from scratch with bidirectional navigation, applied to a music playlist manager with forward/backward playback

- **Assignment Trees:** BST-based file system navigator with O(log n) file search, extension filtering, and hierarchical directory management

- **Assignment Graphs:** Flight route network navigator implementing BFS for shortest paths and Dijkstra's algorithm for cheapest routes with comprehensive network analysis
